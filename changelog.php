$changelog = <<<'EOT'

= 3.1.2 =

* The "X-XSS-Protection" and "HttpOnly flag" options from the "Firewall Policies" page will be enabled by default with new installations of NinjaFirewall.
* The "Firewall Policies" sanitise options (GET, COOKIE etc) will replace all "<" and ">" characters with their corresponding HTML entities "&lt;" and "&gt;".
* Minor fixes and adjustments.
* [Pro+ Edition] It is possible to exclude multiple files/folders in the "File Guard" options page (multiple values must be comma-separated).

= 3.1.1 =
* Speed improvements. The latest set of security rules was optimized to drastically speed up the firewall engine.
* Tweaked two anti-XSS rules to prevent attempts to bypass them using HTML events inside truncated/unclosed HTML tags. Thanks to Sven Morgenroth for reporting the issue.
* [Pro+ Edition] The File Guard and Live Log functions were moved from the firewall main script to two separate scripts inside the /lib/ folder.
* Updated security rules.
* The MJ12bot user-agent was removed from the firewall blacklist. This bot DOES follow the robots.txt and hence there is no reason to blacklist it.
